# Python File Explorer

1. Imported Libraries:
   - Imported tkinter for GUI creation.
   - Imported tkinter.filedialog for file and folder dialogs.
   - Imported tkinter.messagebox for message boxes.
   - Imported os for interacting with the operating system.
   - Imported shutil for file operations like copy and move.

tkinter.filedialog:

askopenfilename(): Opens a dialog box to select a file for opening.
asksaveasfilename(): Opens a dialog box to select a file for saving.
askdirectory(): Opens a dialog box to select a directory.
askopenfilenames(): Opens a dialog box to select multiple files for opening.
asksaveasfile(): Opens a dialog box to select a file for saving and returns a file object.
These methods are commonly used in GUI applications built with Tkinter to allow users to interactively select files and directories.

tkinter.messagebox:

showinfo(): Displays an information message box with a specified message.
showwarning(): Displays a warning message box with a specified message.
showerror(): Displays an error message box with a specified message.
askquestion(): Displays a question message box with Yes and No buttons.
askyesno(): Displays a message box with Yes and No buttons.
These methods are used to display various types of message boxes to communicate information, warnings, errors, and to prompt users for confirmation.

os:

os.getcwd(): Returns the current working directory.
os.chdir(path): Changes the current working directory to the specified path.
os.listdir(path='.'): Returns a list of all files and directories in the specified directory.
os.path.exists(path): Checks whether a file or directory exists at the specified path.
os.path.join(path1, path2): Joins two paths together to create a new path.
These methods are used for various file and directory operations, such as navigating the file system, checking file existence, and joining paths.

shutil:

shutil.copy(src, dst): Copies a file from the source to the destination.
shutil.move(src, dst): Moves a file from the source to the destination.
shutil.rmtree(path): Deletes a directory and all its contents recursively.
shutil.copytree(src, dst): Recursively copies a directory and its contents to a new location.
shutil.make_archive(base_name, format[, root_dir[, base_dir[, verbose[, dry_run[, owner[, group[, logger]]]]]]]): Creates an archive file (e.g., zip, tar) from a directory.
These methods are used for file and directory operations, such as copying, moving, deleting, and archiving files and directories.

2. Backend Functions:
   - `open_file()`: Opens a file using the default system application.
   - `copy_file()`: Copies a file to a specified directory.
   - `delete_file()`: Deletes a specified file.
   - `rename_file()`: Renames a specified file.
   - `open_folder()`: Opens a folder in the default file explorer.
   - `delete_folder()`: Deletes a specified folder.
   - `move_folder()`: Moves a specified folder to another location.
   - `list_files_in_folder()`: Lists all files in a specified folder.
   - `sort_files()`: Sorts files in a specified folder based on their extensions.

3. GUI Initialization:
   - Initialized a Tkinter window.
   - Set window title, size, and background color.

4. Components Placement:
   - Placed labels and buttons for various file operations.
   - Each button is associated with its respective function.

5. Finalizing the Window:
   - Updated the window layout.
   - Started the main event loop to run the GUI.

Overall, the code provides a simple file explorer GUI with functionalities like opening, copying, renaming, deleting files/folders, listing files in a folder, and sorting files based on their extensions.
